## BACKGROUND

### Summary

Gel electrophoresis is commonly used to assess PCR product yield and PCR amplification success. This gel electrophoresis protocol is used by NOAA PMEL Ocean Molecular Ecology (OME) Group.

### Method Description and Rationale

Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA based on its size and charge. When an electric field is applied, DNA molecules migrate through a gel matrix, with smaller molecules moving faster than larger ones. This allows for the size separation of DNA molecules within a mixture - aggregating DNA fragments of similar size and enabling their visualization and identification. The gel is typically stained with a dye and illuminated with UV light to visualize the separated molecules. A DNA ladder containing quantized fragments at set sizes is often run alongside DNA to aid in categorizing DNA fragment aggregations ("bands") by size.

We intentionally chose this protocol as the methodology is widely selected for its simplicity, reproducibility, and ability to provide clear, accurate results. It is an accessible and cost-effective technique commonly used in molecular biology labs.

### Spatial Coverage and Environment(s) of Relevance

While this gel electrophoresis protocol itself is not directly tied to a specific geographic region, it has been used to assess the quality of amplification of DNA from samples collected in diverse environments, including coastal and oceanic stations in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean, Bering Sea, and Arctic Ocean. The DNA analyzed using this method may originate from surface ocean (epipelagic biome) to near-bottom (benthic biome) environments, covering a range of habitats from coastal to offshore regions.

### Personnel Required

One person with molecular biology experience.

### Safety

This protocol does not involve any hazardous chemicals, although standard precautions including wearing PPE should be taken to avoid skin and eye exposure to bleach, ethanol, and agarose.

### Training Requirements

Molecular biology training (including, at a minimum, sterile technique, pipetting small volumes, and running a gel reader) is required to conduct this protocol.

### Time Needed to Execute the Procedure

Preparation of a single 100-well (large) gel takes about 60 minutes. The run time of a large gel is 90 minutes plus the 5-10 minutes required to read the gel. In total, ~160 minutes. Additional gels can be run simultaneously without greatly increasing the time required.

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE


### Preparation

To minimize the risk of cross-contamination, this protocol should be carried out in a dedicated space for post-PCR product handling, separate from areas designated for low biomass bench work. Equipment should not be shared between spaces.

The benches and equipment should be wiped down with 10% bleach, followed by 70% ethanol. This cleaning procedure ensures the removal of potential contaminants, maintaining the integrity of the results. Additionally, it is recommended to use dedicated pipettes, filter tips, and other consumables specific to post-PCR.

#### Loading Dye

Prepare several PCR tube strips of working stock dye and store in the fridge. Add 60 μL dye + 100 μL RNA/DNA-free water to tube strip creating diluted dye mixture.

#### Ladder

Ladder can be pre-made by adding 14 μL 100 bp ladder + 80 μL RNA/DNA-free water + 14 μL dye to a 1.5 mL tube (store in fridge). Carefully label ladder tube with date, initials, and contents. Single use ladder can also be prepared before loading.

* **Single-Use Ladder**: 0.7 μL ladder + 4 μL RNA/DNA free water + 0.7 μL 6x dye

#### 1X TAE Buffer

Enough 1x TAE buffer - both for filling the gel rig and for making the gel - is required before beginning the procedure. To make 1000 mL of 1x TAE, mix 50x TAE buffer with RO water in a 1:50 concentration. For example, 20 mL 50x TAE + 980 mL of RO water in a 1000 mL Pyrex.

#### Gel Rig Set-Up

Gather the appropriate gel combs depending on the number of samples being loaded. There should be a well for each sample, along with at least 2-4 spaces for ladder (2 ladder wells per row of samples is recommended).

Squeeze the gel tray into corresponding rig or external gel caster (depending on size and brand of the rig). Make sure gaskets are snug and not kinked or extruded; use 1x TAE to wet and lubricate if needed. Ensure that gel tray is on a flat surface and level.


### Making a Gel

To make a 1% agarose gel:

1. Measure appropriate volume of 1x TAE using a 1000 mL graduated cylinder and add to a clean 500 mL Pyrex. Use scale to measure agarose on a weigh boat. Add agarose to 1x TAE, then swirl to mix in agarose before heating. Quantities of TAE and agarose will vary depending on the size of rig used. 

| Rig size | 1x TAE | Agarose|
| ----- | ----- | ----|
| Small | 60 mL  | 0.6 g
| Medium |  80 mL | 0.8 g|
| Large | 150 mL | 1.5 g|

2. Microwave the Pyrex with TAE and agarose mixture on high until it begins boiling. Put on heat resistant gloves, remove the Pyrex from the microwave, and swirl gently. Heat until mixture is completely dissolved with no visible particles - this may take multiple rounds. Do not allow mixture to remain at a boil for more that 30 seconds, as mixture may boil over the rim of the pyrex.
3. Allow agarose mixture to cool to touch temperature (i.e., cool enough to hold comfortably or ~55 °C). Large gels take 20-25 minutes. Swirl occassionally to prevent gel congealing around the edges of container. If necessary, cooling can be expedited by running the exterior of the Pyrex under cool water after 10 minutes. 
4. Remove GelRed from dark storage and spin down if needed. Add GelRed to cooled agarose mixture using 0.5-10 μL or 20-200 μL pipettor depending on rig size. Swirl into the solution.

| Rig size | GelRed | 
| ----- | ----- | 
| Small | 6.0 µL GelRed | 
| Medium |  8.0 µL GelRed | 
| Large | 15 µL GelRed | 

5. Pour into the gel rig, place appropriate gel combs, and allow to solidify for 20-30 min. Rinse Pyrex with water 2-3 times to prevent residual gel from solidifying inside. 

6. Once gel is solidified, gently remove the gel tray from the mold or position in the tray and place the gel into the gel rig.
7. Fill rig with 1x TAE. Ensure 1x TAE is completely covering gel. Remove combs gently.


**Note:** 1X TAE used in the gel rig can be reused multiple times. Used 1X TAE can be left in the gel rig for several days if covered between uses to prevent dust and contaminant deposition. Before extended gaps between uses (more than a few days), return used TAE to a 500 mL pyrex bottle. Replace 1X TAE once it turns blue or if it becomes filled with particulates. Used 1x TAE should not be used to make new agarose gels.

### Loading a Gel

1. Load ladder lanes by pipetting 5.4 μL of pre-made ladder into each corresponding ladder well or following recipe for a single well ladder preparation.
    * For large gels, we place a ladder in each corner (4 in total). 
     * Non-filtered pipette tips can be used **only** for this step as there is no PCR product.

2. Spin down PCR plate, double-checking how many wells are filled with PCR product and checking for evaporation.

3. Cover PCR plate rack with parafilm. Gently push parafilm into divots on PCR plate rack to create wells for dye. This is an optional step, but helps ensure samples stay seperate.
4. Use 0.5-10 μL pipettor to pipette 3.2 μL of diluted dye mixture onto parafilm. Prepare one drop of dye for each sample being loaded.
    * A multichannel pipette can be used for this step.
    * Non-filtered pipette tips can be used **only** for this step. If using these tips, it is reccomended to also use a dedicated.

5. Pull back foil of PCR plate. We pull back three columns at a time to prevent cross-contamination and evaporation. Pipette 2 μL PCR product into dye, mix by pipetting up and down ~4 times.

6. Load gel (5.2 μL total). Begin loading with A1 (leftmost well in your first row, next to the ladder well). If using a multichannel pipette, go column by column in the PCR plate, starting with A1 through H1. This will fill every other well. 
    * Gently lower the tip below the surface of the buffer, hovering at the entrance of the well, and slowly dispense the sample into the well without piercing the gel.
   * Change pipette tips between samples to prevent contamination.

### Running a Gel


1. Place the lid securely on the gel rig. DNA is negatively charged and will migrate toward the positive electrode during electrophoresis. Ensure that the gel is oriented correctly. Commonly, the red cable connects to the positive electrode and the black cable connects to the negative electrode.

3. Set power supply to 65 volts (5V per cm) and run for 45-90 minutes, pending gel size.

**Gel Electrophoresis Program**: 

| Rig size | Voltage | Duration |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Small | 40 | 45 minutes |
| Medium | 50 | 60 minutes |
| Large | 65 | 90 minutes|

### Reading a Gel

This methodology is specific to the Analytikjena UVP GelStudio reader.

1. Power on the gel reader. Open the door, pull out the shelf, and then shift the UV plate slightly forward to add gel. Push the UV plate back into position and close the door.
    * Large gels may run off the glass area of the plate; start with gel shifted to right.
3. Open VisionWorks software and click DNA Gel Electrophoresis.
4. On the right side of the screen, click light and turn on the UV/Blue light. Then click filters, and turn on Ethidium Bromide (EtBr). Return to the camera.
5. Next, use the camera to live view on manual to view the gel. Suggest playing with exposure (seconds) and settings under lens tab (i.e. brightness). This allows you to see what looks the best for taking a photo for subsequent annotation of the gel. 

5. Take a photo by clicking the camera icon in the bottom right corner.
    * To save the photo, go to File then Export for Publication. Save as PNG. Saving as a JPEG or TIFF reduces resolution or leads to issues with brightness, respectively. 
    * Add to corresponding folder and name appropriately.
    * Ensure if large gel runs off screen that you capture two photos (i.e., the full gel.
    
6. Use spatula to scoop gel off of reader, and dispose of complete gels. Wipe down the gel reader with a kimwipe. 
7. Rinse the rig with freshwater. Recommend performing a more extensive wash every ~2 weeks. The gel tray should be washed and wiped down after every use.

### Basic Troubleshooting Guide

**Issue 1**: Bubble present in the gel

**Solution**: You can use a pipette tip to gently push the bubble to the edge of the gel so it does not interfere with reading the gel.

**Issue 2**: No bands visible

**Solutions**: There could be various reasons for no bands being visible in the gel.
* Pipetting error
    * Double-check technique; make sure the tip is inside the well when dispensing.
    * Verify that the correct volume of sample and loading dye was used. 
    * Ensure DNA was properly mixed with loading dye before loading.
* Gel issue
    * Ensure GelRed was added at the proper concentration.
    * Keep GelRed protected from light to prevent degradation.
* Gel reader settings
    * Confirm that the correct light source (UV or Blue) and filter (EtBr) are being used.
    * Adjust the exposure settings to improve band visibility.

**Issue 3**: No ladder visible

**Solution**: The most likely reason for no ladder being visible is due to a possible lack of adding GelRed when preparing the agarose.
